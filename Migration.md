# Migration to Code Igniter 4 and Bootstrap 4 #

_12/06/2019_ - **Mehdi Mehtarizadeh**

Migration to CodeIgniter 4 and Bootstrap 4 is necessary at the time of writing. Current CodeIgniter and Bootstrap are obsolete. There are challenges to move the code as the software lacks *technical* and *architecture design documentation*. On the backend side upgrading the code to PHP 7 requires effort. There are major differences in the structure of CodeIgniter 2 and CodeIgniter 4. Moreover, heavy user interfaces currently deployed are dependant on Bootstrap 2. The migration of Bootstrap is expected to bring more unwanted challenges and therefore requires more effort.    
## User Interface Migration ##
---
The user interface benefits from Bootstrap 2.0.2. At the time of writing this report version 4.3.1 is out.
